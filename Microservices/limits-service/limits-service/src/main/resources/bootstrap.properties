# Previously this was application.properties.
# But to connect to Spring Cloud Config Server and fetch the property values, we have renamed this to bootstrap.properties
# NOTE : If you are running a config server and limits service in parallel, then you are running two tomcat instances - each on different ports.
# NOTE : Ports for this service is 8080, 8081, ...


# In this file, we just have application name and Spring Cloud Config Server URL to fetch the property values. 

# This application name and the properties name should be same. This will be the typical part of bootstrap.properties

spring.application.name=limits-service

# URI of the spring cloud config server

spring.cloud.config.uri=http://localhost:8888

# NOTE : First run Spring Cloud Config Server and then start other applications.
# NOTE : If any changes made in Spring Cloud Config Server, the changed files has to be committed in Git
# and then other applications need to be restarted to fetch the updated property values. 


# This is not required since this property is defined in git-localconfig-repo
#limits-service.minimum = 99
#limits-service.maximum = 9999

# If we hit http://localhost:8080/limits we will get the values from default properties file that is in Spring Cloud Config Server.
# If we need to use Dev property values, we can set the following :
spring.profiles.active=dev
# Values will be picked from limits-service-dev.properties

#spring.profiles.active=qa
# Values will be picked from limits-service-qa.properties
